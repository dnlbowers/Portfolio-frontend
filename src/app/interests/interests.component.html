                            Here I will quote my own mum, "Men don't grow up, they just get bigger." I take pride in making 
                            this a life motto. As the proud father of a young boy I never cease to be amazed at the ability Oliver
                            has to find joy and wonder in the simplest of things. Always curious, constantly playful and I get 
                            right in there with him. We both enjoy running around the park together and stopping to ponder the never 
                            ending questions to exit from a 5 year old's imagination.  If you ever find yourself stuck in life, I highly recommend
                            regressing to your inner child, adults can be so dumb ;-)

                            Although out of practice (and considerably less fit than I was once upon a time) I still love to take the time to 
                            slow down, move and breathe. I have studied everything from JuJitsu to Capoeira even including some abstract
                            Russian styles that focus on breath and strength work rather technique and form. Martial arts have taught me discipline and strength
                            of mind which still to this day enables me to overcome challenges on and off the matt.
