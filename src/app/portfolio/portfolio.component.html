            Above is a collection of my recent projects. Although I have been self-learning various 
            coding languages for years, the above is an amalgamation of my current learning. Any 
            suggestions for improvements to your user experience are welcome. For more details 
            about each project and my source code, visit

            I continuously learn, grow, and improve my skill sets, so everything here will likely 
            evolve soon. I am happy to collaborate or take on project ideas. If you're interested 
            in building something, please contact me via the <a routerLink="/contact">contact page.</a>
